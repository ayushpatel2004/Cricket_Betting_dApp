# Cricket_Betting_dApp
Betting on sports is a common practice worldwide. However, traditional betting involves several intermediaries and lacks transparency, making it difficult to determine the fairness of the process. We propose to build a `decentralized web application (dApp)` for betting on cricket matches, which will be built on `Ethereum blockchain technology`. The aim is to enable transparent transactions to take place and prevent data tampering. The betting can be done on the player or the winning team. A fixed amount of money will be allowed per player, and the prize pool will be divided between the winning bettors. The interface for the dApp will be built using `React framework` and `ethers` library, and the smart contracts will be implemented using `Solidity`.
