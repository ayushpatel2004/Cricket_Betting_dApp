The dApp uses smart contracts to facilitate secure and transparent betting transactions without the need for intermediaries such as bookmakers. Users can connect their Ethereum wallets to the dApp and place bets on various outcomes of a cricket match, such as the winning team or the top scorer. The dApp also includes features such as automatic payout distribution based on the outcome of the match.</div>

            <li>
            Install the MetaMask extension for your web browser and create a new account.
            <li>Add some ether to your MetaMask wallet by purchasing it from a cryptocurrency exchange or transferring it from another wallet.</li>

            <li>Enter the amount of ether you want to bet and confirm the transaction in MetaMask.</li>
